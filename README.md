# Howdy folks! :cowboy_hat_face:

## Welcome to my github page ;)

I'm a curious Data Scientist :bar_chart: and Post Doctoral Researcher in Evolutionary Biology (mostly birds :bird: ) at INPA, Manaus, in the Brazilian Amazon :seedling:. I have a natural hunger for learning new stuff and I love to explore data, find patterns, ask and answer intriguing questions.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on constructing a database for INPA's Genetic Resources Collection in Postgrees and Python and performing data analyses with it to provide the institution data-based inteligence for decision making.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about deep learning algorithms and SQL.

## Under Construction
# :building_construction: :construction_worker_man: 
I'm currently revisiting all my scripts and codes, organizing and uploading them as I advance. I apologize and ask you to be patient as this might take a little while. But it is never too late to get serious about sharing knowledge. The intention is to upload here all the data and code I have used along my research carreer but also the stuff I'm learning now.

You are welcome to contact me anytime if you have any questions or just want to chat about science and data analyses.
