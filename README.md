## Welcome to my github page ;)

I'm a curious Data Scientist :bar_chart: and Post Doctoral Researcher in Evolutionary Biology (mostly birds :bird: ) at INPA, Manaus, in the Brazilian Amazon :seedling:. I love to explore data, find patterns, ask and answer intriguing questions.

I've been using programing languages to do research and data analyses in biological science for a while, but recently decided to get more serious about among other things making my codes and studies acessible to everyone including me. I'm here to share and acquire knowledge on data analyses and programming.

## Under Construction
# :building_construction: :construction_worker_man: 
I'm currently revisiting all my scripts and codes, organizing and uploading them as I advance. I apologize and ask you to be patient as this might take a little while. But it is never too late to get serious about sharing knowledge. The intention is to upload here all the data and code I have used along my research carreer but also the stuff I'm learning now.

You are welcome to contact me anytime if you have any questions or just want to chat about science and data analyses.
